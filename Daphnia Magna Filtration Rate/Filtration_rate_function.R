  # dry_mass_threshold is the threshold to decide if a daphnia organism should be
  # considered as juvenile or adult. According to Burns et al.1969. Daphnia 
  # organisms with length lower than(approximately) 1.5 mm are considered as juveniles.
  # Based on the given equation that relates the dry mass to the length of the 
  # organism in the same paper ( W (mg) = 0.0116*L^2.67 ), the dry mass 
  # of a daphnia with length 1.5 mm has dry mass equal to 0.034mg. So daphnia 
  # organism with dry mass greater than this threshold must be considered as adults
  # for the calculation of F_rate.
  
  # Keep ony the data for immature or adult daphnia based on the 
  # age and adulthood_threshold given.
